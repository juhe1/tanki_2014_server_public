# Tanki 2014 server
This is server for the original 2014 version of tanki online. I don't anymore develop it. I thought that maybe some one has some use for this server (because i don't need it), so i decided to make it public. This server is not finished and not ready to use. To be able to connect client to this server you need to add all tanki 2014 resource files to the "client_resources" folder. After you added all files, you need to edit some paths from "generate_client_resource_folder.py" script and then run it. Then you can run the server. Note that you may get some errors, because when i stoped developing i was middle in making isida, so it may cause some errors (haven't tested).
